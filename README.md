# FreakyRTOS

**FreakyRTOS** is a lightweight, preemptive real-time operating system designed for embedded systems, with a focus on portability, simplicity, and efficiency.

## Features
- Preemptive task scheduler
- Software timers
- Semaphores and mutexes
- Message queues
- Tick-based timing system
- Portable and modular codebase

## Getting Started
To see how FreakyRTOS is used in practice, check out the [FreakyNetworking](https://github.com/maanavkoladia/FreakyNetworking) project. It provides complete examples of:
- Task creation and management
- Synchronization using semaphores
- Timed events
- Real-time network handling using the RTOS core

## Supported Platforms
- TI TM4C microcontrollers

## Toolchain
- Built using the GNU ARM Toolchain

## Notes
FreakyRTOS is a minimal, educational RTOS suitable for hobby and academic use. Its integration with FreakyNetworking makes it a strong starting point for developing connected embedded systems.
